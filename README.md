1. Update settings files to suit your needs.
   Make sure you update the following:
   * AWS credentials (under settings/production.py)
   * Database connections (under settings/production.py)

   This will make deployments much easier.
   * local git repo
   * remote git repo (code hosting)
   * remote git repo (server)

0. Initialize the virtual environment
```
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh; workon default
```

1. Making changes to the database (Models)
```
python manage.py migrate
```

2. Making changes to static files (under /assets)
   ...

3. Installing dependencies
**On your machine**

```

**On the remote server**

Deployment
==========
When you are done writing code on your machine it's time to push the code on
a server for the world to enjoy:

**On your local machine:**
1. Commit your changes

2. Push your changes to your production server git repo.

3. Push your changes to your git hosting repo.


**On the server:**
Once you have pushed your code to the server (using ```git push```) you need
to re-generate your static files.

1. Compress JS & CSS (django-compress):
```
python manage.py compress
```

2. Copy files from /assets/ to /static/ and push them to Amazon S3 (django-storage):
```
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

3. If you have made changes to your database you need to run migrations (south)
```
python manage.py migrate
```
